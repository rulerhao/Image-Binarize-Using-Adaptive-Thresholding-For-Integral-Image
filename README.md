# Image_Binarize_Using-Adaptive-Thresholding-Using-the-Integral-Image-
Adopt "Adaptive Thresholding Using the Integral Image" to implement.
The main purpose is select out the similar part of image. So that we can recongnize like iris, pupil, people or items.

# Example Image

![image](/Merged_Image/Merged_Image.jpg)

# Time Complexity
Time complexity = O(n^2 )
The prove please watch in the Time_complexity.pdf(https://github.com/rulerhao/Image_Binarize_Using-Adaptive-Thresholding-Using-the-Integral-Image-/blob/master/Time_complexity.pdf)
